        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Tajveer Singh Dhesi, a computer science and mathematics student studying at Colgate University. I was born in Durham city, County Durham, England, proudly known for its high ranking university, close to where I chose to take my A-levels at Durham Johnston Sixth Form. While I was there, I had 2 very enjoyable years where I was elected Head Boy, a member Sixth Form Committee and opted to do an Extended Project Qualifiation along with my 4 A-levels (Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer Science).
        </p>
        <p>   
            From there I left the United Kingdom to explore new opportunities in the USA, where I was offered a place at Colgate University as an Alumni Memorial Scholar. I have spent 3 years at Colate University and have thoroghly enjoyed my time here, having been a member of great communitites and have taken part in exciting opportunities. From exploring the history and culture of Puerto Rico to spending a semester in Australia, Colgate has offered me some invaluable experiences and taught me important lessons that I will certainly take forward into my future endevours.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now in search of a opportunities to utilize my skills that I have aquired in a role that both enhances my current skillset, as well as developing my personal and professional portfolio. It is with confidence I say that I am sure that I would flourish in such a role.</p>
